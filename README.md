# The Monkees

Stream One Project: User Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is a website on the monkees providing sample music and videos to showcase to potnetial fans and people who may wish to book them.
It contains sections with a background on the band and enables them to book the band byt using the booking form.

## Demo
A live demo can be found [here](https://davidcotter2.github.io/Milestone-Project-One/).

## UX
 
My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible to access information on the site, while striving for a minimalist design. 
I tried to make it easy to navigate while also providing useful information.

## Features

The features used in this project include responsive media design to ensure the user experiences the best site possible.
The site provides access to music to download.
The booking form available to users in contact us enables easy access to booking events.

## Technologies Used

1. HTML5
2. CSS
3. [Bootstrap (4.3.1)] (https://getbootstrap.com/)
4. [Fontawesome (4.7.0)] (https://fontawesome.com/)

## Testing
This site was tested across multiple browsers and on multiple mobile devices to ensure compatibility and responsiveness the site adapts well to all screen sizes.
I proceeded to vigorously test the site and found the technology worked as it was supposed to. 
For example, in the booking form if all sections are not completed an error message appears.

## Deployment

This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The live site updates automatically each time there is a new push to the repository.
